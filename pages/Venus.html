    <h1>Venus</h1>
    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it the closest to Earth. 
        Neighbouring Earth with a size allmost as large and with a similar composition Venus is sometimes called Earth's "sister" or "twin" planet. 
        Venus, like Mercury, appears in Earth's sky relatively close to the Sun either as morning star or evening star, resulting from them orbiting the Sun inside of Earth's orbit.</p>
